[[BF16_extensions]]
== Extensions

The group of extensions introduced by the BF16 Instruction Set
Extensions is listed here.

Detection of individual BF16 extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.

The BF16 extensions defined in this specification (i.e., `Zfbfmin`,
`Zvfbfmin`, and `Zvfbfwma`) depend on the single-precision floating-point extension
`F`. Furthermore, the vector BF16 extensions (i.e.,`Zvfbfmin`, and
`Zvfbfwma`) depend on the `"V"` Vector Extension for Application
Processors or the `Zve32f` Vector Extension for Embedded Processors.
Finally there exist dependencies between the newly defined extensions:
`Zvfbfmin` depends on `Zfbfmin` and `Zvfbfwma` depends on `Zvfbfmin`.

This initial set of BF16 extensions provides very basic functionality
including  scalar and vector conversion between BF16 and
single-precision values, and vector widening multiply-accumulate
instructions.
