Description:: 
Convert BF16 to FP32. The conversion is exact.

This new floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to the other floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.
This instruction is similar to `vfwcvt.f.f.v` - Convert single-width float to double-width float. However, it is only defined for SEW=16.

Any attempt to execute this instruction with an SEW other than 16 will result in an illegal
instruction exception.

Exceptions: Invalid


Operation::
[source,sail]
